# Fridge AI - Streamlit App

This Python code deploys a Streamlit app that allows users to upload pictures of their fridge and identifies what food items are in the fridge. The app then calls the OpenAI API and asks a GPT model what dishes can be created from the available food in the fridge. Finally, the app outputs an image of the dish using DALLE 2.

## Installation

Once the app is running, you can upload an image of your fridge and click the "Analyze" button. The app will identify the food items in your fridge and use them to generate a dish using the OpenAI API and DALLE 2. The output image will be displayed on the app.
